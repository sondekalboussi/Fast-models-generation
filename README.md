Rapid increase in genome sequencing has led to the accumulation of huge amount of sequence information that needs to be studied. Structural and functional annotation of new proteins is a critical task and is often based on structure information derived from homologous proteins.

In some cases proteins diverge and since structure is more conserved than the sequence among time, structural divergence is slower than sequence divergence so establishing a direct sequence search based is not easy to study the relationship between them .Distantly related  proteins generally have a pairwise sequence identity below 25% and have diverged from a common ancestor. They are also referred as  remote homologs. These proteins share similar 3D structure, conserved regions (domains) and function.

An accurate detection of distantly related homologs can facilitate the assignment of putative functions for new proteins to improve the genomic function annotation. Molecular functions and the structure of the protein domains are well conserved unlike the cellular functions.  Domain-centred approach to structure and function  prediction,  use of remote homolog detection methods have a huge potential to better understand protein structure function and evolution. Recent advances include nonlinear scoring functions combining various sequence features, the use of sequence context information, and improved software packages.

Comparative modelling of proteins using  the program MODELLER has been used in this study. MODELLER program generates three dimensional homology models of proteins with unknown structure. The method relies on an input sequence alignment between the target amino acid sequence to be modeled and a template protein whose structure has been solved. 

My work is involved in new approch for 3D protein structure prediction for remote homolgues using fast generated profiles and HMM-HMM alignment to produce fast and accurate models hopefully that will be used in the Topcons web server for consensus prediction of membrane protein topology.

The main goal of this study is to produce good models for remote homologs in less time than the traditional method.
